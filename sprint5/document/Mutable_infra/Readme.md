## Why Use Mutable Infrastructure?

| Reason                 | Description                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick fixes            | Allows immediate changes without requiring full redeployment.    |
| Legacy compatibility   | Works well with traditional systems and existing workflows.      |
| Low initial setup cost | No need for advanced tooling or frequent environment rebuilding. |
| Adaptability           | Ideal for environments needing rapid and frequent changes.       |

## What is Mutable Infrastructure?

### Definition

Mutable Infrastructure refers to infrastructure that can be modified or updated directly after deployment. Changes can include updates, patches, or reconfigurations applied to live systems.

### Working Approach

| Step                      | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy Infrastructure     | Systems are set up using tools like manual configurations or scripts.       |
| Apply Updates and Changes | Updates, patches, or modifications are directly applied to running systems. |
| Monitor and Maintain      | Regular monitoring ensures the system remains operational post-updates.     |
| Backup Data               | Data and configurations are periodically backed up for safety.              |

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages

| Advantage                     | Description                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick fixes                   | Allows real-time updates without downtime or full redeployment. |
| Cost-effective                | Low resource overhead for changes compared to full rebuilds.    |
| Compatibility                 | Works well with legacy and traditional setups.                  |
| Simplified initial deployment | Requires minimal setup compared to immutable approaches.        |

### Disadvantages

| Disadvantage               | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Configuration drift        | Inconsistent configurations over time due to ad-hoc updates.     |
| Troubleshooting complexity | Difficult to debug due to lack of standardization.               |
| Security risks             | Increased attack surface due to live updates and manual changes. |
| Not scalable               | Challenging to manage at scale with multiple systems.            |

## Real-World Examples

| Example                        | Description                                                                 |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| On-Premises Systems            | Companies running traditional servers often use mutable approaches.         |
| Legacy Application Maintenance | Maintaining old applications that cannot easily adapt to immutable methods. |
| Quick Hotfix Deployment        | Applying security patches or fixes in live environments.                    |
| Dev and QA Environments        | Mutable setups for testing purposes where changes are frequent.             |

---

## Conclusion

Mutable Infrastructure offers flexibility and speed, making it suitable for environments requiring rapid and frequent changes. However, it comes with risks like configuration drift and security vulnerabilities. Careful consideration of use cases, coupled with robust monitoring and backup strategies, can mitigate these risks. For modern, large-scale systems, immutable infrastructure might be a better choice due to its reliability and consistency.
